# Flask Rebar REST API Demo
This code accompanies the [blog post outlining exactly how to generate an SSL certificate on Ubuntu 18.0.4, automate renewal and attach it to Nginx](https://think-engineer.com/blog/how-to-obtain-an-ssl-certificate-for-a-containerised-web-application-for-free) written by [Adam](https://github.com/amitchone) for [Think Engineer](www.think-engineer.com).

### How to use
If you really don't want to read the [blog post](https://think-engineer.com/blog/how-to-obtain-an-ssl-certificate-for-a-containerised-web-application-for-free) then simply clone the repository to a machine running Ubuntu 18.0.4:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Think-Engineer/docker-compose_nginx_ssl_demo
```
And then read the blog post. It's free information; I don't want to type it out twice.
